<!-- About Me -->
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I study at the James Madison High School in Brooklyn. I am passionate about physics, electronics, programming, and research. I enjoy building devices using microcontrollers, exploring scientific problems, and applying technology to solve real-world challenges. My biggest dream is to enter UF where I will study my favorite field.</p>

<!-- Why MIT -->
<section id="why">
  <h2>Why University of Florida?</h2>
  <p>University of Florida is a place where innovation, engineering excellence, and hands-on research meet real-world impact. I want to be part of a community that pushes the boundaries of technology and transforms ideas into solutions.</p>
  <p>I'm especially inspired by UF's work in robotics, embedded systems, and artificial intelligence.
    I am particularly interested in the high-temperature sensor research led by Professor Mark Sheplak, Professor Roozbeh Tabrizian, and Professor Philip Feng, as well as the work on robotic hands with human-like sensitivity conducted by Professor Eric Du. These projects showcase UF's cutting-edge achievements in electronics and robotics and inspire me to further my studies and actively participate in research.
